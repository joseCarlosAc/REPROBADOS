# REPROBADOS
## Description
Reprobados is a puzzle video game where you have to solve puzzles to find some objects. Is important to mention this game is in Spanish. 

This game is a project for an introducing programming class, which is why the language is Python; Python is an easy language to learn. This project uses the Turtle library because it is usually included in Python, and you donâ€™t have to install it.

The biggest challenge in this project was how to show all the things on the screen and how to use the Turtle library correctly .(this project was made in December 2020)
